Description: Infers mobility events from bibliometric data, implementing the
    tenure events method from Herman, A., (Forthcoming), "Reconstructing
    bibliometric methods for studying mobility." Classifies peoples' changes
    in affiliations as being migration or temporary migration, according to
    model parameters for backfilling missing affiliation data, tenure overlap
    between affiliations, and the duration of temporary positions. The package
    also identifies events that may have been mobility events, but which are
    ambiguous because of censoring or affiliation reporting.
