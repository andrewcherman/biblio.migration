#' Identify Potential Migrations
#'
#' This function identifies individuals who may have migrated based on their
#' affiliations in a specified focal year. It looks for individuals who have a new
#' position in the focal year while having at least one pre-existing affiliation.
#'
#' @param tenure_data A data frame containing tenure information with columns
#' `person_id`, `est_start_year`, and `est_end_year`, among others.
#'
#' @param focal_year An integer representing the year in which new affiliations
#' are to be assessed for potential migration.
#'
#' @return A data.table containing potential migration events, including details
#' about both pre-existing and new affiliations, as well as the career start and end
#' for each individual identified as a potential mover.

#' Classify Migration Events
#'
#' This function classifies migration events based on the presence of
#' ruptures between new and old affiliations. A rupture is defined
#' by the overlap of years, while a gap is defined by the time between
#' old and new affiliations. For more details see Herman, A. (Forthcoming)
#' "Reconstructing bibliometric methods for studying mobility."
#'
#' This function is meant for internal use, as it estimates migration events
#' for a single focal year.
#'
#' @param temp_data A data.frame or data.table containing potential migration events, including
#' columns such as `new_start_year`, `new_end_year`, `old_start_year`,
#' `old_end_year`, `old_geo`, and `new_geo`.
#'
#' @param focal_year An integer representing the year in which migration
#' classification is to be assessed.
#'
#' @param allowable_overlap An integer representing the maximum allowable
#' overlap between the new and old end years for a migration to be classified
#' as a rupture.
#'
#' @return A data.table containing classified migration events, with an indicator
#' for migration and the year of migration.

#' Classify Temporary Events
#'
#' This function classifies temporary events based on the relationship
#' between new and old affiliations, as defined in Herman, A. (Forthcoming)
#' "Reconstructing bibliometric methods for studying mobility.". A temporary event is
#' defined as a situation where the new affiliation ends before the old
#' affiliation ends.

#' @param temp_data A data.frame or data.table containing potential temporary events, including
#' columns such as `new_start_year`, `new_end_year`, and `old_end_year`.

#' event classification is to be assessed.
#'
#' @param allowable_temporary_overlap An integer representing the maximum
#' allowable duration for a temporary event to be classified as such.
#'
#' @return A data frame containing classified temporary events, with an indicator
#' for temporary status, the start year of the temporary event, and its length.
